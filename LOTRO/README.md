LOTRO.xpadderprofile
====================

- this profile makes heavy use of xpadder's multi-profile support
-- it binds 1-4, 5-9, 0-= to buttons A,B,X,Y in profile 1, 3 and 4
   to allow use of all quick slots
- to be effective, you'll need a razer sabertooth or another controller
  that can map virtual buttons.  I map Dpad-Left and Dpad-Right to the 
  underside buttons.
