Notes
=====
- I rebound mouse Right-Click to interact (e.g. the 'e' key) in the oblivion in-game controls (instead of the default "block").  This allows for "right-click" functionality and "interact" functionality on the A-button.  I also recommend keeping a wireless mouse next to you for picking stuff up in game, reading books, etc.
- there is no block button on the controller.  I never use it.
- I make use of xpadder's multi-profile support: _while_holding_ down the left-trigger, the controller switches to "2nd profile" mode.  2nd profile rebinds the left and right joysticks to keyboard arrow keys allowing you to navigate oblivion's menus and inventory screens.  A-button: Enter/Select/Yes.  Start-button: Esc/No/Back  B-button: alt-tab to windoz.
- you might want to experiment with the "Turbo" speed setting on the joystick up/down key mappings in second profile.  iirc, I was going to make one joystick faster than the other (to allow quick up/down through inventory), but never got around to it
- I've labeled the controls for the primary profile in the jpg
